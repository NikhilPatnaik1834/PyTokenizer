# PyTokenizer

The PyTokenizer is a simple compiler with a tokenizer feature. The tokenizer assigns tokens to the different elements of the input file (a python script). A general Python tokenizer library exists but it does not offer specific details on the types of functions used or the types of libraries imported. The PyTokenizer allows for these specifications to be made.
